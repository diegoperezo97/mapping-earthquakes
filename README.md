# MODULE 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Overview of the Analysis

* I have just secured a fantastic job opportunity: _"Specialist in Data Visualization for the Disaster Reporting Network"_. A non-profit organization that uses statistics to create stories about disasters all across the world. If I accept the mission, I will be tasked with creating interesting data visualizations with interactive elements on earthquakes from across the world.

* Basil, the chief of the seismic disaster response team, feels that this initiative will be beneficial to his team of reporters and data visualization experts. He expects that producing earthquake maps that are both informative and easy to use on desktops and mobile phones would help the Disaster Reporting Network gain traction.

* In my new role, I'll assist in the construction of websites and mobile applications by utilizing the most recent earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS website. Using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries, I'll browse and obtain earthquake data, then plot it on a Mapbox map via an API call.

* Each earthquake's magnitude and location will be displayed in a popup marker on your map. The size and color of the marks for each earthquake should correspond to the magnitude of the event. Higher-magnitude earthquakes will look larger and darker in color, and a legend will provide context for my map data.

* Finally, fault lines will be added to the map to show the link between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates. I'll be able to upload my earthquake map to your online portfolio once I've finished it. If I play my cards well, the team may invite me to continue on and build similar disaster maps in the future.
